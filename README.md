#### Description:
This Res, a app to find the correct resolution for the exact needs. Just enter a width and height and it will find th aspect ratio and prints all the resolution in that aspect ratio. I made this using Django with Python, it is just a simple nested for loop and a if condition. I hope this might be useful.
